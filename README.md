# PowerBi

This project features an interactive Power BI dashboard built from a sales dataset, designed to visualize key performance metrics and uncover business insights. It includes four distinct visualizations:

Profit by Country (Filled Map)

Sales and Profit Over Time (Line Chart)

Total Sales by Category (Stacked Bar Chart)

Average Profit by Ship Mode and Region (Stacked Column Chart)

The dashboard supports dynamic highlighting and filtering by profit, sales, country, segment, category, and product, offering a user-friendly interface for intuitive data exploration and decision-making.
